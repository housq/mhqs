block all connections except for
	1. nintendo 3DS wifi connection test, GET function
	2. nintendo and capcom HTTPS connections when entering DOWNLOAD mode of MH4G (no idea what they are used for)
	3. redirected connections for download edited quests
This will make 3DS unable to connect to any other contents except for MH4G quest downloading. It's useful if you want
to run this server in a public IP, but may cause inconvenience in other cases.
I will try to add some attributes to make this feature optional.
